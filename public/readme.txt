Common things you should remember :

1)Don't pass state variables to setState in React
2)Make your React components single responsibility
3)Make your side effects single responsibility
4)Use ternaries instead of && in JSX

Iâ€™ve put together a short list of three custom React hooks worth using in almost every project you make.


1) useFetch Hook
2) useForm Hook
3) useLocalStorage Hook

There are three building parts:
 actions, store, and reducers.
